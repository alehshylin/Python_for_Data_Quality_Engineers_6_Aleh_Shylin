Today is 06 October, 2022 
Average temperature in Vilnius for today is 12.35

And today's horoscope for Scorpio zodiac sign is: 
Your imagination will take you for a ride today, dear Scorpio, as the moon enters visionary Pisces and the sector of your chart that governs creativity.
This luminary placement could lead to daydreams, doodling at your desk, and artistic genius, making it important that you nurture the whimsical notions that flow through your psyche.
However, grounding will play an important role in maintaining efficiency, so be sure to spend a few moments finding your center.
You'll have an opportunity to strengthen your friendships later this evening when Mercury connects with Pluto, so be sure to make yourself conversationally available.
